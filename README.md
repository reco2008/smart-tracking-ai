Smart Tracking AI: A modern logistics and vehicle tracking system powered by AI&amp;Telal
## Smart Tracking AI

**Project Description:**
Smart Tracking AI is an innovative logistics management system designed by Telal and OpenAI. The system provides vehicle control, enabling users to track vehicles, analyze vital data, and manage fleets efficiently. It offers cutting-edge services like fuel consumption analysis, driver behavior monitoring, and detailed reporting. Additionally, it aids in diagnosing vehicle issues and identifying faults using artificial intelligence. The system also allows sending commands, receiving data, communicating with drivers, and reducing traffic congestion through alerts and alternative route suggestions.
